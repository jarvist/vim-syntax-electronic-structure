# vim-syntax-electronic-structure

Basic Vim syntax files of use for electronic structure input/output files.

NWCHEM electronic structure package input deck (.nw extension), and an even cruder one for Gaussian (.com). 

Put the ones you want in ~/.vim/syntax, and add a suitable loader to ~/.vim/filetype.vim to automatically detect based on file glob. These were designed with the Zenburn colour scheme in mind.
